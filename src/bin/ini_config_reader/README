use a queue buffer to get all bytes up until =
to get the value, and then everything after we place into another queue.

we then link these together like a linked list, and then for the key, we then add another key, so it forms somewhat of a linked list
which we will then hold in memory, and then runs as a daemon in order to get key/value pairs and to update things

or can just create a hashtable, so we hash, the first queue, and then place the second queue in the index array
